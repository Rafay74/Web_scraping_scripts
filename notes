1.Connecting Reliably:

page = requests.get("https://www.xyz.com")
There are two main things that can go wrong in above line:
- The page is not found on the server (or there was some error in retrieving it)
- The server is not found

In the first situation, an HTTP error will be returned. This HTTP error may be “404 Page
Not Found,” “500 Internal Server Error,” etc. In all of these cases, the urlopen function
will throw the generic exception “HTTPError” We can handle this exception in the
following way:

try:
  html = requests.get("www.zyx.com")
except HTTPError as e:
  print(e)


If the server is not found at all (if, say, http://www.pythonscraping.com was down, or the
URL was mistyped), it returns a None object. We can add a check to see if the returned html is None

if html is None:
   print("URL is not found")
  else:
   #program continues

2. Using this BeautifulSoup object, we can use the findAll function to extract a Python list
nameList = bsObj.findAll("span", {"class":"green"})
for name in nameList:
  print(name.get_text())
  
findAll(tag, attributes, recursive, text, limit, keywords)
find(tag, attributes, recursive, text, keywords)

For example, the following function would return both the green and red span tags in the HTML document:
findAll("span", {"class":"green", "class":"red"})

bsObj.findAll(class_="green")
Alternatively, you can enclose class in quotes:
bsObj.findAll("", {"class":"green"}
